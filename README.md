# Video Tutorial to these notes.

* I recorded about 20% of these notes in videos in 2015 in Mandarin (all my notes and writings are in English) You may find them on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UConITmGn5PFr0hxTI2tWD4Q) and [优酷](http://i.youku.com/i/UMzIzNDgxNTg5Ng)

* I always look for high quality PhD students in Machine Learning, both in terms of probabilistic model and Deep Learning models. Contact me on YiDa.Xu@uts.edu.au
